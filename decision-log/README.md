# Decision Log

A record of significant design and architecture decisions made in this project.

## When to log a decision

- A design rule is changed, bent, or extended
- A new component or pattern is introduced with non-obvious reasoning
- A structural or architectural choice is made that affects reuse or portability
- A trade-off is accepted that future contributors should understand

## Format

Each entry is a numbered markdown file:

```
0001-short-descriptive-name.md
```

Each file should include:
- **Date** and **Status** (Accepted, Superseded, Deprecated)
- **Context** — why the decision came up
- **Decision** — what was decided
- **Files changed** — what was modified
- **Trade-offs** — pros and cons considered
